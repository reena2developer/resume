 As a Full Stack Developer, I design and develop web applications, integrating front-end and back-end. I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Angular for user interfaces, and Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and SQL for server-side operations. I deliver scalable, maintainable solutions tailored to business needs.
